# Birthdays - A Birthday Reminder

Birthdays is a native iOS-App, created using SwiftUI, that allows you to store the birthdays of your friends, colleagues and acquaintances in one place and sends you a reminder, when the big day is here. 

Yeah, of course there are other plattfoms that can do that as well, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and your contacts/calender app. But in that mess, finding out the birthday of someone can be a bit of a struggle. Moreover, if you don't have push notifications enabled or get a lot of them from those apps, you easily miss out on something. And since it also turned out to be a great starter project for getting deeper into iOS-Development, I decided to built something on my own for just that purpose.
